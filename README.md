## About the project

The seals portal aims at displaying all of the resources in the CDLI concerning a seal, aggregated in one place, with important features like viewing image annotations and graphical representation of seals chemistry.

### 3. Seal Chemistry Add forms

- \*Final outcome:*\
   - Users can add the chemical information about a seal by uploading a csv sheet and choosing a calibration file.
       - Users can also Export a chemistry file as CSV.
       - Admins can delete a particular Entry.
   - Users can also add a calibration file for standards of the instrument taking the chemical information.
       - This also includes credits information.

### 4. Artifact Viewer Page

- *Final outcome:*\
   - Users can view zoomed version of an artifact image with annotated areas.
       - They can also view the credits for a particular annotation 
- *Methodology:*
   * This was achieved using the Annotorious and Openseadragon library.

* Addition of additional features.
* Documentation

## Acknowledgements

Participating in GSoC was a great learning curve for me, I faced alot of challenges in this journey which helped me in learning new skills. I would like to thank my mentors [Jacob Dahl](https://www.orinst.ox.ac.uk/people/jacob-l-dahl) and [Timo Homburg](https://github.com/situx) for guiding me and helping me throughout my GSoC journey. I shall always be indebted to such a welcoming organisation to help me enhance my coding skills.
